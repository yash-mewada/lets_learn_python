# daemon thread = a thread that runs in the background, not important for program to run
#                 your program will not wait for daemon threads to complete before exiting
#                 non-daemon threads cannot normally be killed, stay alive until task is complete
#
#                 ex. background tasks, garbage collection, waiting for input, long running processes
